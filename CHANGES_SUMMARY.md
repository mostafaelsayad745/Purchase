# Summary of Changes

## Problem Statement (Arabic)
The issue described several problems in the tool request and purchase request forms:

1. "Show Details" button in tool requests page not working
2. "Send to Purchase" button should be available for ALL statuses, not just "OutOfStock"
3. Error when clicking "Send to Purchase" button
4. Create tool request form should accept text input (not dropdown selection) for tool name and work area
5. Need to add requester name and status fields to create tool request form
6. Purchase request form should accept text input for tool request (not dropdown selection)
7. Purchase request form missing fields: quantity, request date, status, approver, approval date
8. Error when saving purchase requests

## Changes Made

### 1. Tool Request List Component (`tool-request-list.component.html` & `.ts`)

**Fixed "Show Details" button:**
- Added `(click)="viewDetails(request.id)"` event handler to the button
- Implemented `viewDetails()` method to show an alert with request details

**Enabled "Send to Purchase" for all statuses:**
- Removed `*ngIf="request.status === 'OutOfStock'"` condition from the button
- Now the button is visible for all tool request statuses

### 2. Backend - PurchaseRequestsController.cs

**Fixed "Send to Purchase" error:**
- Removed validation that required tool request status to be "OutOfStock"
- Now purchase requests can be created for tool requests with any status
- Removed the code:
  ```csharp
  if (toolRequest.Status != "OutOfStock")
  {
      return BadRequest(...);
  }
  ```

### 3. Tool Request DTOs (`ToolRequestDtos.cs`)

**Added support for text input:**
- Made `ToolId` optional (`int?`)
- Added `ToolName` property (string)
- Made `WorkAreaId` optional (`int?`)
- Added `WorkAreaName` property (string)
- Added `RequesterName` property (string)
- Added `Status` property (string)

### 4. Backend - ToolRequestsController.cs

**Enhanced CreateToolRequest to handle text input:**
- Accept either `ToolId` or `ToolName`
- If tool name provided and doesn't exist, create a new stock item
- Accept either `WorkAreaId` or `WorkAreaName`
- If work area name provided and doesn't exist, create a new work area
- Accept `RequesterName` and create new user if needed
- Accept custom `Status` value

### 5. Create Tool Request Form (`create-tool-request.component.html` & `.ts`)

**Changed to text input fields:**
- Changed tool name from datalist to regular text input
- Changed work area from datalist to regular text input
- Added requester name text input field
- Added status dropdown field (Pending, InStock, OutOfStock, Rejected)

**Updated component logic:**
- Removed validation requiring selection from lists
- Updated form data model to include `requesterName` and `status`
- Simplified submission to send names instead of IDs

### 6. Purchase Request DTOs (`PurchaseRequestDtos.cs`)

**Added support for comprehensive form:**
- Made `ToolRequestId` optional (`int?`)
- Added `ToolRequestName` property (string)
- Added `Quantity` property (int?)
- Added `RequestDate` property (DateTime?)
- Added `Status` property (string)
- Added `ApproverName` property (string)
- Added `ApprovalDate` property (DateTime?)

### 7. Backend - PurchaseRequestsController.cs

**Enhanced CreatePurchaseRequest:**
- Accept either `ToolRequestId` or `ToolRequestName`
- If tool request name provided, find existing or create new tool request
- If tool doesn't exist, create new stock item
- Accept `ApproverName` and create new user if needed
- Allow custom `RequestDate`, `Status`, and `ApprovalDate`

### 8. Purchase Request List Form (`purchase-request-list.component.html` & `.ts`)

**Replaced dropdown with text inputs:**
- Changed tool request from dropdown to text input
- Added quantity number input
- Added request date datetime-local input
