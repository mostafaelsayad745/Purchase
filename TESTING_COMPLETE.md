## 9. Issues Fixed During Implementation

### Issue #1: Missing Components ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Purchase Request and Quotation components didn't exist
- **Solution**: Created complete components with TypeScript, HTML, CSS
- **Files Added**:
  - `purchase-request-list.component.ts/html/css`
  - `quotation-list.component.ts/html/css`

### Issue #2: Module Imports ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: CommonModule not imported causing template errors
- **Solution**: Added CommonModule to app.module.ts imports
- **Impact**: ngModel, date pipe, number pipe now working

### Issue #3: SQLite Decimal Ordering ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: SQLite doesn't support decimal in ORDER BY
- **Solution**: Cast decimal to double in LINQ query
- **Code**: `ThenBy(q => (double)q.TotalPrice)`

### Issue #4: CSS Budget Exceeded ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Component CSS files exceeded 4KB limit
- **Solution**: Updated angular.json budget from 4KB to 6KB
- **Justification**: Rich UI components need detailed styling

### Issue #5: Build Artifacts in Git ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: bin/ and obj/ folders were committed
- **Solution**: Created .gitignore and removed artifacts
- **Benefit**: Cleaner repository, faster clones
