## Build Status
✅ Application builds successfully
✅ No compilation errors
⚠️ Bundle size warnings (acceptable for development)

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test manual purchase request creation
2. Test manual quotation creation
3. Verify quotation archiving on selection
4. Test all filters (name, date, status)
5. Test pagination controls
6. Verify all navigation buttons in dashboard
7. Test all create forms
8. Test all detail views
9. Verify text input with datalist for tool requests
10. Test end-to-end workflow from tool request to payment

## Known Limitations
1. Tool request text input requires matching existing items in database (backend constraint)
2. Archived quotations stored in localStorage (not persisted to backend)
3. Filtering is client-side (all data loaded then filtered)

## Future Enhancements
1. Server-side pagination for large datasets
2. Backend API for archived quotations
3. Advanced search with multiple criteria
4. Export functionality for reports
5. Email notifications for workflow steps
